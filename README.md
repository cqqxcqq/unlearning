# unlearning
the current standard is to retrain the model from scratch—which is prohibitively expensive ($10M+) and slow. The research gap lies in **"Surgical Unlearning"**: How do we mathematically remove a specific concept or data point from a model's weights *without* degrading its general reasoning capabilities or language fluency?
